# Progress Bar Animation Task

## Objective
Your task is to complete the implementation of a progress bar animation with the following requirements:

- **Progress Bar Animation:**
  - Create a progress bar that animates from 0% to 100% in a specified duration (e.g., 3 seconds).
  - The progress bar should start animating when a button is clicked.

- **Queue Handling:**
  - If the button is clicked multiple times, queue the progress bars so that each one starts animating only after the previous one finishes.

- **Requirements:**
  - Use the provided base HTML and CSS.
  - Implement the functionality using vanilla JavaScript.
  - Ensure that the solution is well-structured and optimized.
  - The code should easily accommodate additional requirements with minimal changes.

## Files

- `index.html`: Base HTML structure.
- `styles.css`: Base CSS styles.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file to be completed.

## Instructions

1. **JavaScript Implementation:**
   - Add the functionality in `script.js`:
     - **Progress Bar Creation:** Add a new progress bar to the DOM when the button is clicked.
     - **Animation:** Animate each progress bar from 0% to 100% over a duration of 3 seconds.
     - **Queue Management:** Ensure each progress bar starts animating only after the previous one has finished.

2. **Considerations:**
   - Ensure that your code is well-structured and easy to understand.
   - Test your solution to handle multiple progress bars correctly.
   - Make your code modular and maintainable for future changes.

Good luck, and happy coding!
